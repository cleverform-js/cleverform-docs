# Validation rules

Easily add form validations for every `form` fields using Cleverform validation rules.


- validation Rules has its own unique name.

- Rules precedence is left to right. If one validation fail it will throw validation error msg and the next validation rules will be ignored (per field).

- Validation rule names are semantic. Describe what its done as a validation rule.

- Some validation rules may  modify field attribute. Ex. required.

- Some rules have parameter/s, some parameters are required , some are optional.

- You can use multiple rules in one field by using pipe  "|"




```js
// example of multiple rules for field `first_name`
"first_name" : "required | minLen:6 | maxLen 10"
```

<!-- -be careful in combining validation rules, ex: "min:10 | max:8" -->

## Rule parts
A validation rule contain __3__ main parts.



<!-- `[rule name]:[param 1],[param 2],[param nth]` -->

<!-- ```js
'minLen:1'
``` -->

| Part | Description | Example
| :-- | :-: | :-: 
| name | - the unique name of the validation rule | _required_ ,  _minLen_ , _maxLen_
| colon (:) | - the colon char separates the `rule name` and its `parameters`. <br/> __Optional__ | _:_
| parameters| - rule's parameters needed for validation. Multiple parameters is seperated by comma (,) <br/> __Optional__ | It can be _number_ or _string_ type

⚠️ Rule names are case sensitive, so _minLen_ is different from _minlen_.


## Example Usage

```js

const regForm = new CleverForm({

    // The id of the html form
    id: "registrationForm",

    // 6 fields under validation
    rules: {
        first_name: "required | minLen:2 | maxLen:50",  // 3 validation rules
        last_name: "required | betweenLen:2,50", // 2 validation rules
        email: "required | email",  // 2 validation rules
        password: "required | minLen:6 ",  // 2 validation rules
        confirm_password: "required| matched:password",  // 2 validation rules
        terms_and_condition: "accepted",  // 1 validation rule
    },
    
    // Other options...
});
```
