# Custom validation rule

You can add custom validation rules where you have control of how validation is done.

Your logic must determine if the field value passed your validation rule.

To do that, you have to follow some simple rules to have a working customized validation rule.

Use the __CleverForm's__ static method __addRule__ API to create your very own validation rules.

>   CleverForm.addRule(RuleObject)

⚠️ You don't need to use the __new__ keyword when creating a custom rule. It is only used when instantiating a form.


## RuleObject properties
The addRule method expects a ruleObject parameter that has __3__ properties.


| Property | Description | Type
| :-- | :-: | :-: 
| name | __Required__ - the name of your custom validation rule. | __string__
| errorMessage | __Required__ - the custom error message that will be used. | __string__
| validate| __Required__ - the callback function that contains your validation codes.<br/>The function must have a __fieldValue__ parameter which is the field's value under validation.<br/>You can use that value for your validation rules internal logic.<br/> The __fieldValue__ is a string type, so if you're dealing with number fields, you must use _parseInt()_. <br/> <br/>⚠️ Return __true__ inside the function if the value passed your logic, otherwise __false__.<br/>⚠️ Omitting a return statement inside your function will let your validation rule fails and emit error all the time. | __function__ 

⚠️ Properties are case sensitive.


## Example 
```js

// Create a custom validation rule `divisibleBy5`

CleverForm.addRule({

  name: "divisibleBy5",
  errorMessage: "The :fieldName field must accept number divisible by 5.",
  validate: function (fieldValue) {
    // Your validation logic ...

    const number = parseInt(fieldValue);
    if (number % 5 === 0) {
        // true  - means value passed your validation logic
        return true;
    } else {
        // false - means value failed your validation logic, your custom errorMessage will be displayed.
        return false;
    }
  }, // validate end

});


// Use your custom validation rule after adding

const mySpecialForm = new CleverForm({
    id: "formIdHere",
    rules: {
        age : "divisibleBy5",  
        //other fields here...
    },
    // ...
});

```

⚠️ You should not use any built-in rule names to your custom rule to avoid rule names collision.
