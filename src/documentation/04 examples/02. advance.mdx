___

## # Complex files rules

In this example, you can have <input type='files' /\> with complex file validation.

The validation rules applied are:

```js
/**
 * 'required'              -> The field is required
 * 'extensions:image'     -> The selected files must be an image file
 * 'minFiles:3'           -> Select at least 3 files
 * 'maxFiles:5'           -> Select a maximum of 5 files
 * 'maxFS:1,MB'          -> Each file SIZE must be less than or equal to 1 MB
 * 'betweenTFS:3,4,MB'  -> The TOTAL file size of all selected files must be between 3 - 4 MB.
 * /
```

> ðŸ’¡ This will save you a lot of server bandwidth since the file/s validation will be on the client-side.
