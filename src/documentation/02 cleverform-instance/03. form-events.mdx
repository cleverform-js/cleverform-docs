# Form events
CleverForm's form events are the most important part of the entire validation process.

There are three (3) form events we can respond to or listen to.

1. __[onInit](#-oninit)__ - On Initialized event
2. __[onError](#-onerror)__ - On Error event
3. __[onSuccess](#-onsuccess)__ - On Success event

<!-- - On Initialized, _triggered event when the form is initialized by CleverForm._
- On Error, _triggered event when at least 1 field in the form has an error when trying to submit._
- On Success, _triggered event when a form has no error when submitted._ -->

__formEvents__ option contains the forms events object which is __[event name] / [callback function]__ value pairs. 


```js
// Example
const regForm = new CleverForm({

    id: "registrationForm",
    rules: {...},

    // formEvents holds the three events callback function/listeners
    formEvents: {
        onInit: function() {

            // your codes here to run when the form is initialized.
        },
        onError: function( errors, errorsCount, attemptsWithError ) {

            // your codes here to run when the form has field with validation error.
        },
        onSuccess: function( validatedData, formData, formSubmit ) {

            // your codes here to run when the form 
        },

    },
    // other options....

});
```


ðŸ’¡ Event property names are case sensitive.

ðŸ’¡ The event's callback functions/listeners are __OPTIONAL__.

ðŸ’¡ __onError__ and __onSuccess__ callback functions have access to parameters that you can work within your callback function block statement. 


## # onInit

On form initialized, _triggered event when the form is initialized by CleverForm._

```js
// Example Usage
...
onInit: function() {

    console.log("My form is now initialized by CleverForm");

    // You can hide/show an HTML element when a form is initialized.

    // Example is showing a loading icon/modal by default in the DOM while the page is loading(due to user's slow internet connection),
    // and when the form is initialized, you can hide the loading icon/modal here.

},
...
```


## # onError

On form error, _triggered event when at least 1 field in the form has an error when trying to submit._

The __onError__ callback function can access three (3) optional parameters provided by CleverForm.


| Order | Value type  &nbsp;| <center>Description</center>| Name | 
| :----: | :-----: | :-----: | :-----:     |
| 1st param | _object_ | -  collections of field errors, __[fieldName] / [errorMsg]__ value pairs.   | __errors__ |
| 2nd param | _number_ | - the number of fields with error  | __errorsCount__ |
| 3rd param | _number_ | - the number of attempts to submit form with error.  | __attemptsWithError__ |

ðŸ’¡ The parameter names above are the suggested name's, you can change parameters name.
What matters is the order of the parameter.

```js
// Example Usage
...
onError: function( errors, errorsCount, attemptsWithError ) {

    console.log("My form has validation error/s");

    console.log("Fields with error :" + errors);
    console.log("Fields with error count:" + errorsCount);
    console.log("You have tried " + attemptsWithError + " attemps in submitting form with error.")

},
...
```



## # onSuccess

On form success, _triggered event when a form has no error when submitted._

The __onSuccess__ callback function can access three (3) optional parameters provided by CleverForm.


| Order | Value type  &nbsp;| <center>Description</center>| Name | 
| :----: | :-----: | :-----: | :-----:     |
| 1st param | _object_ | -  collections of fields value, __[field name] / [field value]__ value pairs.   | __validatedData__ |
| 2nd param | _object_ | - validated data in a [FormData](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData) instance.   | __formData__ |
| 3rd param | _function_ | - You can invoke formSubmit() method to submit the form via normal submit | __formSubmit__ |

ðŸ’¡ The parameter names above are the suggested name's, you can change parameters name.
What matters is the order of the parameter.

ðŸ’¡ __formData__ can then be easily sent via the XMLHttpRequest.send() or other HTTP request client.
This can be convenient for those who are working with PHP on the server.

```js
// Example Usage
...
onSuccess: function( validatedData, formData, formSubmit ) {

    console.log("My form has no validation error. Submit the form now via XML HTTP requests.");
    console.log("Fields data :" + validatedData);

    // submit formData here via fetch, AJAX ,axios or other XML HTTP clients.
    
},
...
```

ðŸ’¡ When a form is submitted without any error and if the __onSuccess__ callback function is omitted,
the form will be submitted normally.
