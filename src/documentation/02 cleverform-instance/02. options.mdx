# Options
__CleverForm__ _constructor function_ expects only one (1) paramater which is an __object__.

That object contains collection of __[optionName] / [value]__ pairs.

Below are the list of options.

| Name &nbsp;&nbsp; | Value type  &nbsp;| <center>Description</center>
| :---- | :-----:    | :-----:     |
| **[id](#-id)** |  _string_   | __Required__ - the id of HTML form that you want to have form validation |
| **[rules](#-rules)** |  _object_   | __Required__ - Contains the fields validation rules |
| **[customName](#-customname)** |  _object_   | __Optional__ -  holds every fields custom name in the error messages|
| **[cssClass](#-cssclass)** |  _object_   | __Optional__ - hold CSS classes|
| **[formEvents](#-formevents)** |  _object_   | __Optional__ - holds every form events where you can listen to|

<!-- | **[settings](#-settings)** |  _object_   | __Optional__ - hold form settings for its behavior.| -->


```js
// Using all option example
const regForm = new CleverForm({

    id: "registrationForm",
    rules: {...},
    customName: {...},
    cssClass: {...},
    formEvents: {...},
    

});

```

<!-- settings: {...}, -->


ðŸ’¡ Option names are case sensitive.


## # id
The id attribute value of the HTML <form\> tag that you want to have form validation.

```html
<form method="POST" id="registrationForm" >
    <!-- Fields and Submit button here... -->
</form>
```

```js
// Example
...
id: "registrationForm",
...
```



## # rules
__rules__ option contains the fields validation rules object which is __[field name] / [validation rules]__ value pairs. 

The validation rules are _string_ type.

Using multiple rules are seperated by pipe '|'

```js
// Example
...
rules: {
    f_name: "required | minLen:2 | maxLen:50",
    l_name: "required | betweenLen:2,50",
    // Other fields...
},
...
```

ðŸ“ƒ Know more about validation rules in the [Validation rules section](/rules/rules-anatomy)

## # customName
__customName__ option contains the fields custom names object which is __[field name] / [custom name]__ value pairs. 

Custom names will modify the fied name value in the error messages.

Custom names helps to have a user friendly error messages.

```js
// Example
...
customName: {
    f_name: "first name",
    l_name: "last name",
    // Other fields...
},
...
```


## # cssClass

__cssClass__ option holds an object that holds three (3) properties for CSS classes.

CSS classes are used or injected by the library depending on the fields state (with or without error).

1. __fieldSuccess__  &nbsp; - &nbsp;  _CSS class to be injected when Field has successful validation or error-free._
2. __fieldError__  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;  _CSS class to be injected for Field with an error._
3. __labelError__  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;  _CSS class to be injected in the field's <div\>/label that holds an error message._

<!-- 4. __labelSuccess__  &nbsp; - &nbsp;  _CSS class to be injected in the specified label node when the connected field has no error._ -->

When using custom CSS classes, values should be created explicitly inside `<style>` tag or via external CSS (or CSS frameworks like  Bootstrap and Bulma).

```js
// Example
...
cssClass: {
    fieldSuccess: "is-valid",
    fieldError: "is-invalid",
    labelError: "invalid-feedback",
},
...
```

ðŸ’¡ If __cssClass__ option is not customized, __CleverForm__ will use its default CSS classes which you can use conveniently.


<!-- labelSuccess: "valid-feedback", -->

## # formEvents

__formEvents__ option contains the forms events object which is __[event name] / [callback function/listener]__ value pairs. 

There are three (3) events we can respond to or listen to.

1. __onInit__ - On Initialized, _triggered event when the form is initialized by CleverForm._
2. __onError__ - On Error, _triggered event when at least 1 field in the form has an error when trying to submit._
3. __onSuccess__ - On Success, _triggered event when a form has no error when submitted._


```js
// Example
...
formEvents: {

    onInit: function(...) {
        ...
    },
    onError: function(...) {
        ...
    },
    onSuccess: function(...) {
        ...
    },

},
...
```
