## Why cleverform?

> “ We all find the good parts in the products that we use.<br/>We value simplicity, and <b>when simplicity isn’t offered to us, we make it ourselves.</b> ”
<br/>
<i>- Douglas Crockford, <a target='_new' href='https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2998152-javascript'>JavaScript: The Good Parts</a> </i>

One of the most challenging parts of web development is form validations.

__Javascript__ alone has no built-in form validation functionalities.

Implementing your form validation from scratch is very cumbersome and it consumes a lot of time in your development. 

That's why CleverForm library exists!

__In just a few minutes, you can implement form validations.__
