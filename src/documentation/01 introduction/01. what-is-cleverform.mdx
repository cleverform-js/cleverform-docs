## Why cleverform?

> ‚Äú We all find the good parts in the products that we use.<br/>We value simplicity, and <b>when simplicity isn‚Äôt offered to us, we make it ourselves.</b> ‚Äù
<br/>

One of the most challenging parts of web development is form validations.

__Javascript__ alone has no built-in form validation functionalities.

Implementing your form validation from scratch is very cumbersome and it consumes a lot of time in your development. 

That's why CleverForm library exists!

__In just a few minutes, you can implement form validations.__

___

JavaScript beginners can easily understand the library API.


#### ‚úÖ _Zero JS dependencies_
No need to add other javascript libraries.

#### ‚úÖ _CSS library adaptable_ 
Can work with different CSS libraries such as `bootstrap` , `Foundation` , `Bulma` and many more.


#### ‚úÖ _Short code_ 
Form validation in just a few lines of codes.

#### ‚úÖ Built-in validation rules
CleverForm has many built-in validation rules that you can use like __required__, __minLen__, and many more!
