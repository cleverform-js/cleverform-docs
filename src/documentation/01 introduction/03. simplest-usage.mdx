# Simplest Usage

Cleverform is very easy to use and integrate into your project.
Below is the example usage of the library. The example form is a registration form with basic fields.
You can copy and experiment on the codes below to understand it more.

The code snippets include comments that will help you understand more the library.


## # Create your form

Below is the html code for the form where we will add form validation using Cleverform. 

<!-- Filename : _index.html_ -->
```html
<form method="POST" id="registrationForm" >

    <div class="row">
        <label for="f_name">First name</label>
        <div >
            <input type="text" class="field" id="f_name" name="f_name">
            <!-- The div tag below will hold the error message of the field. -->
            <div cf-msg="f_name"></div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Last name and Other fields here ... -->
    <!-- Submit button here... -->

</form>

<!-- Import cleverform -->
 <script src="/your-path/cleverform.dev.js" ></script>
```

## # Instantiate your form
Below is a simple way of implementing form validation using  __CleverForm__ constructor function. 
CleverForm does every field's validation under the hood.


<!-- Filename : _sample.js_ -->

```js
const regForm = new CleverForm({

    // The id of the html form
    id: "registrationForm",

    // The validation rules per field's name, multiple rules are seperated by pipe '|'
    rules: {
        f_name: "required | minLen:2 | maxLen:50",
        l_name: "required | betweenLen:2,50",
        //...
    },

    formEvents: {

        // onSuccess event  hold a callback function/event listener
        // that will run when the form is submitted with out validation errors
        
        onSuccess: function(validatedData) {

            //submit validatedData here via http request in the server
            console.log("Success, Form has No validation error. Submit data via http request in the server (ex: via AJAX , fetch and axios)");
            console.log("validatedData Object: ", validatedData);

        },

        // other events here...
    }

    // ...
});
```

That's it! 🎉

You just implemented a form validation. 👏


## # Accessing value

Optionally, you can easily access the field's current value in the form at __runtime__ by accessing the instance's properties.
```js

// continuation of `regForm` instantiation above...

var firstName = regForm.f_name;
var lastName = regForm.l_name;

console.log(firstName) // prints the f_name value
console.log(lastName)  // prints the l_name value

```

___

>💡 HTML file with multiple forms must have an individual instantiation

```js
// Example
const form1 = new CleverForm({...});
const form2 = new CleverForm({...});
```
